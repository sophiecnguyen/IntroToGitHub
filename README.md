Headings in Markdown are created using the # symbol. The number of # signs denotes the level of the heading:
ex: 
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

Lists in Markdown can be both ordered and unordered:
Unordered lists use *, +, or - followed by a space:
ex: 
* ___
* ___
Ordered lists use numbers followed by a period:
ex: 
1. ___
2. ___

Images in Markdown can be embedded using an exclamation mark followed by brackets for the alt text and parenthesis for the image URL:
ex:
![Alt text](URL)
